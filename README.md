Python Package Requirements
---------------------------

- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Migrate
- Flask-Login
- Werkzeug

---------------------------------------
Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment
----------------------------------------
A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. Using a virtual environment allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately.

Create a Virtual Environment:
1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named 'venv' (you can choose any name):
   python -m venv venv
   This creates a new directory 'venv' in your project folder.

Activate the Virtual Environment:
- On Windows, run:
  venv\Scripts\activate
- On Unix or MacOS, run:
  source venv/bin/activate
  After running this command, your command prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.

Deactivate the Virtual Environment:
- Simply run:
  deactivate
  Use this command when you're done working on the project.

----------------------------
Installing Required Packages
----------------------------
With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages using pip. These commands will install the necessary libraries for your Flask application:

- pip install Flask
- pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
- pip install Flask-Migrate
- pip install Flask-Login
- pip install Werkzeug

Each 'pip install' command fetches the latest version of the package from PyPI (Python Package Index) and installs it in your virtual environment.

Remember to activate your virtual environment each time you work on your project to ensure you're using the right Python interpreter and dependencies.
